# Road-Network
C CLI for a Palestinian cities road network using graphs and MST. Loads cities/distances from file, builds adjacency lists &amp; edge set, and computes an MST via Prim’s (binary min-heap) and Kruskal’s (union–find + min-heap). Prints MST edges, total cost, runtime, and provides side-by-side comparison.
